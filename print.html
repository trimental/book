<p>Welcome to the Rusty Wayland Handbook.</p>
<p>This book is related to the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wayland-client">wayland-client</a> and
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/wayland-server">wayland-server</a> rust crates, and will detail how to use
them to build wayland apps and compositors.</p>
<p>The <a href="./wayland/intro.html">first section</a> is a general introduction on the Wayland protocol, its
goals and architecture.</p>
<p>The <a href="./client/intro.html">second section</a> is dedicated to the building of client apps, that can
run natively in any wayland environment.</p>
<p>The <a href="./server/intro.html">third section</a> focuses on build compositors (or wayland servers), that
act as both window managers and display servers.</p>
<p>Have a good read!</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-wayland-protocol" id="the-wayland-protocol"><h1>The Wayland protocol</h1></a>
<p>Wayland is a display protocol aiming to replace X11, and mostly developed and maintained by former
X.org developers. It is a response to the fact that X11 is an old protocol that accumulated a lot
of unnecessary features over the years, and that its centralised architecture<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> is far too
heavy and has performance issues.</p>
<p>So the choice for waylands design was to make something much more minimalistic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuse the server, the compositor and the window manager into a single program. This means that
there is no longer a single display server, but rather each desktop environment has its own. For
example, both Gnome and KDE have now developed their own wayland compositor.</li>
<li>Don't provide any drawing primitives to the clients. They are responsible for drawing the
contents of their windows themselves, and only pass buffers to the compositor that will then
blend them on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The built protocol aims to be much smaller and simpler than the X11 one, making actually developing
a wayland compositor a much more manageable task than building a new X11 server.</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter is an extensive description of this protocol and what it implies for the
clients and servers, but from a general point of view, and thus is not rust-specific at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>The X11 server is at the heart of everything multiplexing between the clients, the window
manager and the compositor</p>
</div>
<a class="header" href="#wayland-protocol-structure" id="wayland-protocol-structure"><h1>Wayland protocol structure</h1></a>
<p>Before detailing the protocol contents, we need to have a look at its structure.</p>
<p>This is an asynchronous message-based protocol, with an object-oriented structure.</p>
<a class="header" href="#objects-requests-and-events" id="objects-requests-and-events"><h2>Objects, requests and events</h2></a>
<p>Messages are exchanged between the client and the server via a common pool of objects. Each message
is associated to an object and can refer to other objects. Some messages can result in the creation
or the destruction of objects.</p>
<p>Messages from the client to the server are called <strong>requests</strong>, and messages from the server to the
client are called <strong>events</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A client can have an object that represents the keyboard. This object will receive an event each
time the user presses or releases a key.</li>
<li>A client can have an object representing a surface on the screen. It can send a request to the
server to associate a buffer to this surface, to define its contents in terms of pixel values.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All objects are created by other objects, most of them via a request. The set of all living objects
in a wayland session can thus be organised as a tree, on top of which lives a special object named
<code>wl_display</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-display-the-registry-and-the-globals" id="the-display-the-registry-and-the-globals"><h2>The display, the registry and the globals</h2></a>
<p>A client session starts with a single object: the <code>wl_display</code>. This object represents the
connection to the server, and remains alive until the end. This is the entry point of the wayland
protocol: from it instances of <code>wl_registry</code> can be created.</p>
<p>This registry is the real heart of the protocol. Upon creation, it will receive a stream of events
that list to the client the set of <strong>globals</strong> the server presents to it. And this registry
then allows the user to instantiate these global objects.</p>
<p>Globals are of two kind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singleton globals, that represent a capability of the compositor
<ul>
<li><em>For example, <code>wl_shm</code> represents the capability to manipulate shared-memory buffers.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-Singleton globals<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, that reprensent a device the compositor has access to
<ul>
<li><em>For example, the compositor can advertise a <code>wl_output</code> for each screen connected to the
computer.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second kind can appear and dissapear during a session, as devices are plugged or unplugged from
the computer.</p>
<p>In any case, the client can, from the registry, create any number of instances of each global, in
the form of concrete wayland objects.</p>
<p>In the end, this kind of hierachy can be expected:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><em>(The details of what these objects are and do will come later, in the <a href="./wayland/p_core.html">core protocol</a> section.)</em></p>
<a class="header" href="#protocol-extensions" id="protocol-extensions"><h2>Protocol extensions</h2></a>
<p>The set of objects and the list of their requests and events is defined in
<a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/tree/protocol/wayland.xml">an XML file</a>. This approach allows wayland protocol extensions to be defined easily.</p>
<p>A <strong>protocol extension</strong> is just another XML file, which defines another set of objects, some of
them being globals, and thus serving as the entry points for the protocol extension.</p>
<p>All compositors and clients are expected to fully implement the core protocol. However, nothing is
forced regarding extensions. A client knows that a server supports a given extension if the
global(s) it defines are advertised in the events of the registry. If they are not, then the
compositor does not support the extension and the client can act accordingly (falling back to using
only the core protocol, or erroring out if the extension is crucial to the program).</p>
<p>A compositor cannot force the clients to support an extension.</p>
<a class="header" href="#api-versioning" id="api-versioning"><h2>API versioning</h2></a>
<p>The APIs defined by the protocol files are versioned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each global defines a sub-hierarchy of the objects that it can directly or indirectly create.
This whole hierarchy shares the same version number.</li>
<li>Every time a request or an event is added to an object, the whole hierarchy it belongs to has
its version bumped (but several modifications can be made in a single version bump).</li>
<li>A compositor advertises via the registry the maximum version of each global it supports, and
must support any previous version as well.</li>
<li>A client, when instanciating a global, can choose any version of it between 1 and the maximum
supported by the compositor.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#error-handling" id="error-handling"><h2>Error handling</h2></a>
<p>Error handling in the wayland protocol is very simple: whenever the client misuses an object (often
sending a request with invalid arguments) it causes a protocol error. A protocol error is always
fatal, and the server will close the connection whenever one occurs.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Sorry for the lack of a better name...</p>
</div>
<a class="header" href="#the-core-protocol" id="the-core-protocol"><h1>The Core protocol</h1></a>
<p>As described in the previous section, the object hierarchy starts with the <code>wl_display</code>, then
the <code>wl_registry</code>, and then come all the globals from the various protocols in use.</p>
<p>The core wayland distribution comes with <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/tree/protocol/wayland.xml">the core protocol specification</a>. It
contains the <code>wl_display</code> and <code>wl_registry</code> objects<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, as well as some globals that are considered
the common ground that all applications will need. Any fancier functionality is supposed to be
developed in protocol extensions.</p>
<p>This chapter will describe the globals (and their objects hierarchies) from this core protocol. This
is not a complete detailed guide of all requests and events<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, but a general description of how
they are used and interact with each other. It should be enought to properly get started with the
protocol</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Even if <code>wl_display</code> and <code>wl_registry</code> are very special objects and kind of above all
protocols, they are still specified in the core protocol file. But their API is completely set in
stone and locked to version 1, while the rest of the core protocol can still backward-compatibly
evolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Each of them is already detailed in the <a href="https://smithay.github.io/wayland-rs/wayland_client/protocol/index.html">API docs of wayland-client</a>, and there's
no point copy-pasting all of it here.</p>
</div>
<a class="header" href="#special-objects" id="special-objects"><h1>Special objects</h1></a>
<p>Some objects of this protocol are special, and don't belong in the hierarchy of a global.</p>
<p>You already know two of them: <code>wl_display</code> and <code>wl_registry</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-display" id="the-display"><h2>The Display</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_display</code> represents the connection from a client to the compositor. It is automatically
created upon creation of the connection, and can be used by the client to create the <code>wl_registry</code>
and manage the dispatching of events.</p>
<p>It also receives any protocol error generated by the client, allowing a diagnostic of what happened
(but not recovery from it).</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-registry" id="the-registry"><h2>The Registry</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_registry</code> is the gate to all other globals. Upon creation, it receives as events the list of
all existing globals, as well as notification during the whole life of the client whenever a new
global is created or destroyed.</p>
<p>The client can instantiate the registry several times. In this case, each instance will be notified
of all globals.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-callback" id="the-callback"><h2>The Callback</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_callback</code> object is created whenever a client asks the compositor to do something and
requires to be notified when it is done. The callback object has no requests and a single event:
<code>wl_callback::done</code>, which is called exactly once, when the task is finished.</p>
<p>For example, the request <code>wl_display::sync</code> requires the composior to fire the callback just when it
processed the request. It must process the requests in the same order as it receives them, which
guarantees that all pending requests sent before this sync have been processed.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-compositor" id="the-compositor"><h1>The Compositor</h1></a>
<p>The <code>wl_compositor</code> global is the most fundamental of the protocol: it represents the ability of the
compositor (wayland server) to display content on the screen. It probably explains why they both
have the same name (although it can be confusing at times...).</p>
<p>It allows the creation of surface and region objects.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-surfaces" id="the-surfaces"><h2>The Surfaces</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_surface</code> represents an abstract canvas on which the client can display content. A surface
object by itself does nothing: it must first be assigned some content and a role to be displayed.</p>
<p>The content of a surface is assigned by sending a <code>wl_surface::attach</code> request, attaching a
<code>wl_buffer</code> to the surface (we'll learn how to create them in <a href="./wayland/p_core/shm.html">next chapter</a>).
The buffer defines both the size and the pixel content of the surface. As such, a surface can be
resized simply by attaching a new buffer of a different size to it.</p>
<p>The role of a surface represents what it's used for. The core protocol includes 3 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content of a window (see <a href="./wayland/p_core/shell.html">The Shell</a> for details)</li>
<li>Image of the pointer (see <a href="./wayland/p_core/seat.html">The Seats</a> for details)</li>
<li>Child surface of another surface (see <a href="./wayland/p_core/subcompositor.html">The Subcompositor</a> for
details)</li>
</ul>
<p>But others can be introduced by other protocol extensions (for example background image,
screensaver, widget...).</p>
<p>A surface can only have a single role at a given time. A role is assigned to a surface by giving it
as parameter to the request creating the object representing the role.</p>
<p>Many of the properties of surfaces (often inherited from their roles) are double-buffered, and will
all be applied at once when the request <code>wl_surface::commit</code> is sent. Whether a property is
double-buffered is always stated in the API documentation of the requests changing it.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-regions" id="the-regions"><h2>The Regions</h2></a>
<p>A <code>wl_region</code> represents a part of a surface. They are created as a combination of unions and
differences of rectangles.</p>
<p>They serve to requests the need to notify the wayland compositor about a part of a surface. For
example, the request <code>wl_surface::set_damage</code> uses a region to notify the compositor when parts of a
surface have changed and need to be redrawn.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-shm" id="the-shm"><h1>The SHM</h1></a>
<p>The <code>wl_shm</code> object represents the capacity for the compositor to use SHared Memory. This is the
most basic way for a client to send the compositor the contents of its surfaces, and the only one
included in the core protocol.</p>
<p>The SHM global allows the client to create several memory pools. Upon creation, it receives events
for the various buffer formats supported by the compositor (such as ARGB8888 for example).</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-shm-pools" id="the-shm-pools"><h2>The SHM Pools</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_shm_pool</code> is created from the SHM global, and a file descriptor. This file descriptor is
sent to the compositor, and is the shared memory. The compositor will read from it the content
written by the client.</p>
<p>From an SHM pool object, the client can create buffers. Each buffer refers to a certain part of
the memory pool (specifying an offset, a width, a height and a stride).</p>
<p>SHM pools can be resized by the client (via the <code>wl_shm_pool::resize</code> request), but only to make
them bigger.</p>
<p>Creating a buffer referring to content outside of the real size of the pool is an error. The
effective behaviour of the compositor is platform-dependent: either it will read garbage (most
likely zeroed memory) and the content of the surface will silently be corrupt, or it will encounter
an error and trigger a protocol error as a consequence.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-buffers" id="the-buffers"><h2>The Buffers</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_buffer</code> object is actually more generic than SHM pools. It can be created from SHM pools,
but also from other medium in protocol extensions (DMABUF memories for example).</p>
<p>In any case, it refers to some slice of memory at some place (that the compositor is supposed to
have tracked at the creation of the buffer), and can be assigned to any surface.</p>
<p>It possesses a single event <code>wl_buffer::release</code>, sent by the compositor when it has finished
reading from the buffer, signaling the client that the underlying content can now be modified.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-shell" id="the-shell"><h1>The Shell</h1></a>
<p>The <code>wl_shell</code> global allows the client to assign the role of a &quot;window&quot; to a surface by creating
an associated shell surface object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This global is considered <em>deprecated</em> by the wayland dev team, and is apparently
supposed to be replaced by the <code>xdg_shell</code> protocol extension.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that this current interface is considered too simple to properly expose the
functionality needed by popular GUI libraries (such as gtk+ or Qt), and cannot be fixed in a
backwards-compatible way.</p>
<p>However the <code>xdg_shell</code> extension is still in development and no stable version of it exists as of
this writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#the-shell-surface" id="the-shell-surface"><h2>The Shell Surface</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_shell_surface</code> is associated to a surface at creation. It adds to it various properties
making it manipulable by the compositor (and the user of the program) as what we classicaly consider
as a &quot;window&quot;: making it able to be grabbed and moved, resized, hidden, etc...</p>
<p>A shell surface can be in 3 states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toplevel:</strong> this is your classic window, taking a rectangular space in you screen.</li>
<li><strong>Fullscreen:</strong> takes up the whole screen. If the buffer associated to this surface does not match
the dimensions of the screen, they'll be scaled and/or cropped by the compositor, depending on
what the client requested.</li>
<li><strong>Popup:</strong> this shell surface is associated to a parent shell surface, and must be hidden or
displayed at the same time as it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shell surface has a &quot;ping&quot; mechanism: whevener it receives a <code>wl_shell_surface::ping</code> event,
it must answer with a <code>wl_shell_surface::pong</code> request. If the answer takes too much time, the
compositor will consider this shell surface to be unresponsive and notify the user of it.</p>
<p>It also contains the <code>wl_shell_surface::configure</code> event, which is sent whenever the size of the
surface should change, hinting the client of the possible new size. For example when the user
started an interactive resize of the window, or a tiling window manager reorganised the windows it
displays. This new size is not an hard requirement, and the client is free to ignore it (if the
window is not resizeable) or choose a more appropriate size (for example, a terminal emulator that
can only have sizes a multiple of the size of a character).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The state of decorations for windows is still uncertain. Some compositors (like Gnome)
expect clients to draw their own decorations, while others (like KDE) will be drawing server-side
decorations. State of tiling WM (which often expect no decorations at all) is uncertain.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is not yet a clear negotiation protocol for applications and compositors to agree
at runtime about who will handle the decorations.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#the-subcompositor" id="the-subcompositor"><h1>The Subcompositor</h1></a>
<p>The <code>wl_subcompositor</code> object allows the client to assign the &quot;subsurface&quot; role to a <code>wl_surface</code> by
creating an associated <code>wl_subsurface</code> object.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-subsurfaces" id="the-subsurfaces"><h2>The Subsurfaces</h2></a>
<p>When a surface is assigned the <code>wl_subsurface</code> role, it is associated to a parent surface. The
parent surface can be a subsurface of an other surface, and thus a tree of subsurface can be
created.</p>
<p>A tree of subsurfaces has the same visibility state as the surface at its root. This means the root
surface must have a role other than &quot;subsurface&quot; for the tree to be displayed<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The compositor is
expected to handle the whole tree of subsurfaces as if it was a single big surface: the client can
set the location of each subsurface relative to its parent (it is not required for it to be within
the borders of the parent).</p>
<p>Subsurfaces can typically be used for part of the UI that need to be updated by different means. For
example, a video player could have the video itself being a subsurface of the GUI surface: this way
it can update its contents with a buffer coming directly from the (possibly hardware) video decoding
unit.</p>
<p>Subsurfaces can also be used to draw window decorations: this gives an easy way for the client to
know if the pointer is on the decorations or the main surface (see <a href="./wayland/p_core/seat.html">next chapter</a> for details
about pointer input). But in general subsurfaces should not be used for general UI composing: this
is expected to be done client-side by the GUI library.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This means while, strictly speaking, even if a cycle of subsurface is possible to create, the
compositor will never attempt to display it. Thus creating such a cycle is both harmless and
useless.</p>
</div>
<a class="header" href="#the-seats" id="the-seats"><h1>The Seats</h1></a>
<p>A <code>wl_seat</code> global represent a logical group of input devices. Most of the time, setups will
consist of a single seat: the mouse and keyboard of the computer. However some exotic setups can
involve more than one seat<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Seat globals can appear and dissapear as logical seats are created
or destroyed.</p>
<p>A seat can have 3 capabilities, each of them being instantiable as a different object to handle it:
keyboard, pointer, and touch. These capabilities are advertised in an event of the <code>wl_seat</code> after
its creation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#keyboard" id="keyboard"><h2>Keyboard</h2></a>
<p>A <code>wl_keyboard</code> object represents the fact that a keyboard is connected to the seat. It can be
obtained via the <code>wl_seat::get_keyboard</code> request if the seat has this capability.</p>
<p>This keyboard interface is very barebone: the compositor only sends the state of the modifier keys
(control, alt, shift, ...) as well as the raw keycodes of pressed and released keys. Upon creation
of the <code>wl_keyboard</code>, it will also send an event containing a file descriptor with a keymap file,
which is the one currently used by the compositor. The client is then responsible to load it (or
an other) into libxkbcommon to interpret the keystrokes as utf8 characters<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The keyboard has a focus mechanism organised by surfaces. The client is notified whenever one of its
surfaces gains or loses keyboard focus, and only receives keystrokes if one of its surfaces is
currently focused.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pointer" id="pointer"><h2>Pointer</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_pointer</code> object represents the fact that a mouse or a trackpad is connected to the seat,
allowing the user to move a pointer on the screen. It can be obtained via the <code>wl_seat::get_pointer</code>
request if the seat has this capability.</p>
<p>The client is not allowed to track the location of the pointer over the whole screen. Instead, it
receives events whenever the pointer enters or leaves one of its surfaces, and pointer motion events
are given in the surface local coordinates: relative to its top-right corner. The client does not
receive any events if none of its surfaces are under the pointer.</p>
<p>A surface can also be given the role of being the pointer's image, via the <code>wl_pointer::set_cursor</code>
request. To ease this, the wayland C libraries include <code>libwayland-cursor</code>: an helper library for
loading cursor themes and getting buffers of their contents and informations about their animations.</p>
<a class="header" href="#touch" id="touch"><h2>Touch</h2></a>
<p>The <code>wl_touch</code> object represents the fact that a touchscreen is connected to the seat, providing
tactile capabilities. It can be obtained via the <code>wl_seat::get_touch</code> request if the seat has this
capability.</p>
<p>The events associated with the touch object allow representing multi-touch sequences, tracking the
location of each touch point. They can be cancelled if the compositor decides that it'll be the one
handling it.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>I don't have realistic examples to present. A simple possibility would be to plug a second
keyboard to the computer, but the compositor could decide to merge the two keyboard as a single
logical keyboard, as most computers do today. In any case, the compositor gets to decide what a
&quot;logical seat&quot; is.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>This is the exact function of the <a href="https:/crates.io/crates/wayland-kbd">wayland-kbd</a> crate.</p>
</div>
<a class="header" href="#the-outputs" id="the-outputs"><h1>The Outputs</h1></a>
<p>A <code>wl_output</code> global reprensents an output the compositor has access to. Often it'll be a monitor
or a TV connected to the computer. This global only provides the client information about the
physical properties of the outputs, and can be used by other parts of the API as an identifier<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The <code>wl_output</code> globals can appear and disappear as monitors are plugged into or unplugged from the
computer.</p>
<p>Among the information given to the client are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The textual name of this screen (will often be the model &amp; manufacturer if known, or something
like <code>Output #0</code>).</li>
<li>The physical dimensions of the screen as reported by it (the unit is unspecified)</li>
<li>The currently used resolution and refresh rate</li>
<li>Possibly the other supported resolutions</li>
</ul>
<p><code>wl_surface</code>s are notified when they enter or leave an output, but cannot know where they are
located in the coordinate space of the output. The &quot;current output&quot; of a surface which is visible
on more than one output is the one displaying the largest fraction of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>For example, the <code>wl_shell::set_fullscreen</code> request can optionally be given an output as
argument, if the client wants its surface to be set to fullscreen on a particular output.</p>
